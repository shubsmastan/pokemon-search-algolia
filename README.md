# Pokémon Search with Algolia

This application allows users to search for Pokémon data using Algolia's search functionality. The frontend was styled with Tailwind CSS and Pokémon data was updated/retrieved using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Other dependencies used: Axios to get data from Pokémon API, Font Awesome for the lovely icons, Joi for validation and TanStack Store to manage state.
